## About CollectionBuilder CSV

This demo collection features items from the University of Idaho Library's [Psychiana Digital Collection](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/psychiana/about.html), and is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv). Psychiana was a mail-order spiritual movement developed by Frank Robison in 1928. Headquarted in Moscow, Indiana, Psychiana operated its own printing presses and placed its advertisements in newspapers to gain subscribers.

Robison considered himself a prophet, and claimed the name "Psychiana" came to him in a dream.
